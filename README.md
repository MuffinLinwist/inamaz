# Towards a typological approach to the alignments of the argument indexes in Amazonia
This research focuses on the alignment of argument indexes in eleven Amazonian languages: Ashaninka, Bora, Iquito, Kokama-Kukamiria, Murui, Shipibo-Konibo, Shiwilu, Urarina, Wampis, Yagua and Yanesha. The work organizes the languages typologically according to the alignment functions of the bound person forms (Haspelmath 2013). A corpus will be assembled collecting data from the following sources for each language: Shipibo-konibo (Valenzuela 2003; 2010), Urarina (Olawski 2006), Wampis (Peña 2015), Yagua (Payne & Payne 1990; Payne 1993; Payne & Peña 2019) and Yanesha (Duff-Tripp 1997).
